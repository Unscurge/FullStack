Polymorphism (Late Binding) - Ability of different objects to respond to the same message in different ways are called Polymorphism.
Polymorphism allows to design and implement system the are more easily extensible and maintainable.
uses- 1. code reusability
      2. mehod overriding
Early binding - method overloading
Late Binding - method overriding

Polymorphism is achieved using overriding functions using inheritance.
        methods with same name, same signature and same return type in super class as well as subclass.
