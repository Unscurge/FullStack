* Map associates key with value.
* Map cannot contain duplicate key.
* Key and value can be of any java class or interface type.
* one key can have 
types of map :
1. Hashmap class (implements map interface) :-
* contains key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entery.
* allows one null key and multiple null values.
* one key can have at most one value.
* unsorted and unodered and not synchronised.
* get(key) method is used to get value from Hashmap.
* In order to use an iterator, we first need set of keys, which can be retrieved using map.keyset() method.
2. Hashtable
3. Treemap
